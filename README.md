for those with poor sight, the compile button has
been enlarged for convenience to stand out against
**leapcode's** complex controls. **leapcode** has **platform 
specific code** that may or may not run in powershell, 
but is tested in bash shell, so should be well emulated 
in WSL. **The bin directory of your JDK should be in path.**

**NOTE: leapcode is developed for and developed on linux,**
**and has no support for proprietary nvidia drivers. When you**
**have a choice, keep open source in mind!**
